Parsing date and time.


Writing code to parse date and time from a given string.

Code is mainly using Duckling for Date time Parsing and for other labels like Location, Person etc. Spacy is being used.

Example Input: I am going to Kormangala market tomorrow morning
Output:

 [ {'GPE': 'Kormangala'},
 {'Date': [{'from': '08/15/2020'}, {'to': '08/15/2020'}]},
 {'Time': [{'from': '00:00:00'}, {'to': '12:00:00'}]}
 
Example Input: I will be in bangalore between 6th to 7th may
Output:
[{'Date': [{'from': '05/06/2021'}, {'to': '05/08/2021'}]},
{'Time': [{'from': '00:00:00'}, {'to': '00:00:00'}]}]
