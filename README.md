#1. Nearest School for each Houses problem 
This is a problem for finding nearest school coordinates for each of given house coordinates, Assuming that the coordinates are not normal (x,y) coordinates, these are (longitude, latitude) coordinates on a globe. Assuming globe as a perfect sphere.

Here we are using Haversine formula for finding distance between two points on a sphere and using Numpy and Pandas for reducing computation time for large datasets.
